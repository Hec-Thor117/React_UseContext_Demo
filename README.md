# React_UseContext_Demo
A demo of the React UseContext hook 

The UseContext hook can be useful for reducing "prop drilling" by allowing the developer to store variables inside the hook and then allowing the dev to use those variables elsewhere in the application.

I like to think of it as:
## Before UseContext
1. Grandma wants to give me $20.
2. Grandma gives my parents the money.
3. My parents give me the $20.

## After UseContext
1. Grandma wants to give me $20.
2. Grandma deposits the money directly to my bank account, no involvement of my parents.
